Hello, I am a composer of contemporary music working with acoustic instruments, analog and digital electronics, and field recordings. For the past five years, I have been developing a practice that explores the idea of sound as an acoustic phenomenon that, as artistic material, offers the unique characteristic of being fundamentally spectral: although sound is emitted by vibrating entities in physical space, the absence of a bodily materiality by the time it is perceived by the listening subject lends itself to an experience determined by what is not physically and tangibly present. With this as a point of departure, I have been building a musical language that is defined by a narrative around what is not actually there, an aesthetics of absence and the illusion of presence, an aural phantasmagoria of sorts.

My music has been performed in the Americas, Europe, and Asia by ensembles such as ELISION Ensemble, Distractfold, JACK Quartet, the Quatuor Diotima, Ensemble Dal Niente, Ensemble Hand Werk, and the Dresdner Philharmonie. I have been an active participant in festivals such as the Schloss Solitude Sommerakademie (Stuttgart, Germany), the International Young Composers Academy (Tchaikovsky, Russia), Visiones Sonoras (Morelia, Mexico), and FIMAC 2017 (Cuenca, Ecuador) and have received awards and commissions from institutions such as Score Follower, the New Talents Biennale Cologne, and ACAM (Costa Rican Composers Association).

I am a founding member of GLAM (Group for Latin American Musics), a collaboration with the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (DRCLAS) designed to promote Latin American music at Harvard and in Latin America through concerts and academic activities.

Currently a PhD candidate in music composition at Harvard University studying with Chaya Czernowin and Hans Tutschku, I have a Bachelor of Music degree in composition from McGill University and a masters in composition and electronic music from the Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden, where I studied with Mark Andre and Franz Martin Olbrisch.
