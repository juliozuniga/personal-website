    <p>PROGRAMME NOTE:<br>
    In the fall of 2016, several U.S. diplomats working for the American embassy in Havana fell victim to what was initially described in American media as a sonic weapon supposedly devised by the Cuban government. Once that theory was dismissed for its absurdity, and in part due to a lack of evidence and the seemingly complete absence of communication between U.S. and Cuban scientists investigating the case, the explanation that circulated in the news media for several months was that cicadas on the island were so loud that they made the U.S. officials ill.</p>
    <p>In 1978, Mercedes Sosa recorded Mar&iacute;a Elena Walsh&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Como la cigarra,&rdquo; which became a popular protest song against the Latin American right-wing authoritarian regimes of the second half of the 20th century. &ldquo;Singing to the sun like the cicada / after a year underground, / like a survivor / returning from war,&rdquo; goes the chorus. In fact, most periodic cicadas spend 17 years underground as nymphs before emerging to reproduce and die.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Jakob von Uexk&uuml;ll discovered that a tick completely deprived of nourishment could survive in an inert state for as long as 18 years. After that time, when provided blood, the animal awoke to feed and died.</p>

    <p>This piece is being played live from a different room and fed into the hall through the loudspeakers around you. The piece is the third part of a three-year-long project that culminates tonight. I am very grateful to Madison, TJ, Zach, Lauren, and Megan, for making this happen.</p>

    <p>PROGRAMME NOTE:<br>
    This piece is a sort of travelogue of the past eight months or so, if a travelogue can be made from travels within a 600-meter radius from my place. Over the course of these eight months, i have collected pictures, field recordings, fallen leaves and flowers, thoughts, drawings, and anecdotes, most of them while spending the days by myself — lately with a dog. Some of these items are now here, in this score or in the tape part that will revive their specter during performance and when people listen to the recording of the piece at home. Others served more as points of departure into imaginary travels for the interpreters and listeners of the work that will manifest sonically.</p>
    <p>The phrase “schemes that offer us a sense of futurity” appears in the first entry of <i>Parallel Peaks</i>, the contribution that my friend, Danny Walden and i made to Fonema Consort’s <i>Digital Mural</i>, posted on January 18, 2021, accessible online <a href="https://www.fonemaconsort.com/our-digital-mural/parallel-peaks-monday" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
    The piece shares with the mural its general framework as well as many of the collected items, albeit in a much more individual sense here. I owe a lot of the inspiration to Danny nonetheless and see both works as intimately tied.</p>
    <p>Initially, things in <i>schemes that offer us a sense of futurity</i> were supposed to be held together conceptually by alluding to the myth of <i>la llorona</i>, though it would be a stretch to claim that is still the case at this point. Traces of her specter can be found everywhere, but instead of holding items together these traces bathe them in her aura, with no attempt to amalgamate. Unlike me, she’s not interested in collecting them.<br>
    The work in its current state is the travelogue of imaginary trips facilitated by all of these ideas during a time when stimuli were few and far apart, and when moving beyond 600 meters was not possible physically, but very much a necessity for the mind.</p>
